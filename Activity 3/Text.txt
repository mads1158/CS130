(BOUNS) Catering
1)first ask how many of each bakery item they would like
2)Then we can use a clever formula to calculate the total of each ingredient
- Having the form of (# of Cheesecakes)*(# of this ingredient required for a single item) + (# of cakes)*(# of this ingredient required for a single item) + (# of cupcakes)*(# of this ingredient required for a single item)
3) Then as we process that for each ingredient, then we can print the amount of each ingredient we need to order
